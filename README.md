# Algorithms
These are my implementations of existing algorithms and data structures in C++. There are many just like it, but this one is mine.

This repository is a compilation of algorithms/data structures written in C++, these algorithms are popular existing algorithms and I do not take credit for any of the work done. You are free to use these codes wherever you may wish without permission. 

A lot of these algorithms are found in the book: Introduction to Algorithms by Cormen et al. I recommend this book to anyone interested in learning algorithms.
