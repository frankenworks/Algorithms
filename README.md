# algorithms
These are my implementations of existing algorithms and data structures in C++. There are many just like it, but this one is mine.

This repository is a compilation of algorithms/data structures written in C++, these algorithms are popular existing algorithms and I do not take credit for any of the work done. You are free to use these codes wherever you may wish without permission. 

A lot of these codes are based off the algorithm implementations of PetarV- and you can check his github page, github.com/PetarV-
